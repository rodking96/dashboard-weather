# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
